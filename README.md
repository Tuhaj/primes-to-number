This was an experiment

Some numbers represented in binary show positions of prime numbers with their binary mask. Let's call them "metaprimes".

Q: Are there any prime numbers that are "metaprimes"?

A: Yes, eg. 53

Q: Is there a non-prime number that does it?

A: Yes, eg. 849

Result: not interesting, maybe better notation rules can be found
